# Amazon Giveaways - Scraper 
Yes, there are many amazon giveaways scrapers over there but this one is mine; it was created based in the Google Puppeteer browser + Electron base to fire the browser.
I'm not convinced that those giveaways are real, never won a single one, but anyways I wasted my time doing this just because, just because I could.

## Usage

1- Download the project.<br>
2- Install the required modules
> npm install<br>


3- Install the correct Cookies

4- Run the electron app
> npm start


5- Click the "Run" button<br>
6- Check the console for the results

## Roadmap
- Maybe allow users to login into their accounts, this way simplify the cookies usage(atm cookies are hard-coded).
- Move results to the Electron APP display, the window is already there, just doing nothing but launch the browser atm.
- Add a mechanism to allow pause and resume progress, and controll it with the app.
- Amazon changes their interface all the time, from time to time, things will stop working and need to be fixed.
